## ACTIVE PROJECTS

### freelance-system
- **Repo:** github.com/salasoliva27/freelance-system
- **Type:** Automation pipeline (existing, operational)
- **Interaction model:** Gate-driven — pauses at every client decision point
- **Stage:** Operational — ready for first real leads
- **Modules:** build ✅, gtm ✅, performance ✅, learnings ✅, financial ✅
- **Modules excluded:** validation (already validated), campaigns (not applicable), legal (not needed for service delivery)
- **Target market:** Freelance clients on Upwork, Fiverr, PeoplePerHour — tech stack matched
- **Positioning rule:** Open with willingness to underbid in exchange for reviews. Immediately establish credibility with client's specific tech stack and years of experience. Frame as a deliberate trade — senior-level delivery at below-market rate in exchange for review. Never apologetic, never desperate.
- **Status:** ✅ Ready to run. No leads yet in CSV.
- **Notes:** Nocturne Solutions collab cases pre-loaded in portfolio.

### lool-ai
- **Repo:** github.com/salasoliva27/lool-ai
- **Type:** B2B SaaS — virtual try-on widget for Mexican optical SMEs
- **Interaction model:** Spec-fed — Jano defines product parameters; field notes fed manually or via Gmail after store visits
- **Stage:** Validated — ready for build
- **Modules:** validation ✅, build ⬜, gtm ⬜, campaigns ⬜ (later), performance ⬜, learnings ⬜, financial ⬜, legal ⬜ (LFPDPPP — image data)
- **Target market:** Independent optical stores in Roma, Condesa, Polanco, Lomas, other CDMX SME-dense neighborhoods
- **Validated version:** B2B SaaS widget — white-label virtual try-on embedded on store website or WhatsApp catalog. Priced in MXN (~800–1,500 MXN/month). Onboarded in Spanish. Simple catalog upload (product photos, no 3D modeling required). B2C layer comes after 20+ stores have live catalogs.
- **Key legal flag:** Handles facial image data → LFPDPPP compliance required before any real user data is collected
- **Status:** ⬜ Repo live. Module structure initialized. Build not started.

### espacio-bosques (bosques-poc)
- **Repo:** github.com/salasoliva27/bosques-poc
- **Type:** Blockchain community investment platform

- **Stage:** Smart contract complete (22/22 tests passing) → Sepolia deployment pending
- **Modules:** build ✅ (contract), build ⬜ (React frontend), gtm ⬜, performance ⬜, learnings ⬜, financial ⬜, legal ⬜ (CNBV, blockchain asset regulation — heavy)
- **Target market:** Bosques de las Lomas residents + local service providers
- **Immediate next steps:** Alchemy account → testnet ETH → MetaMask private key in .env → npm run deploy:sepolia → React frontend (4 screens)
- **Key legal flag:** Blockchain-based investment → potential CNBV regulatory territory → validate before real funds
- **Status:** ⬜ Not yet registered under venture-os. Smart contract phase complete.
