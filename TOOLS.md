# TOOLS REGISTRY
## Venture OS — Dynamic Discovery
## Last updated: 2026-03-25

## PHILOSOPHY

The tool and skill ecosystems grow by thousands per month. No static list stays current. This system discovers both on demand and learns from real use. **`learnings/mcp-registry.md` is the single source of truth for what actually works.**

---

## THE DIFFERENCE: MCP TOOLS vs SKILLS

**MCP Tools** give Claude access to external systems at runtime — GitHub, Gmail, databases, APIs. Claude uses them to *act on the world*.

**Skills (SKILL.md)** teach Claude *how to do something* before a task starts — domain expertise, workflows, design systems, security patterns. Like a recipe Claude reads before cooking.

They compose: Sentry's code review skill defines the PR analysis workflow; the Sentry MCP fetches the live error data. MCP is the kitchen. The skill is the recipe.

## MCP TOOL DISCOVERY PROTOCOL

When a project or session requires a capability not currently in `.mcp.json`:

### Step 1 — Check the registry
Read `learnings/mcp-registry.md` → MCP TOOLS section:
- **GOOD** → propose immediately with install command
- **BAD** → explain why, search for alternatives
- **UNTESTED** → proceed to Step 2

### Step 2 — Use Claude Code's built-in MCP Tool Search
```bash
claude mcp search "[capability]"
```
This searches the MCP registry with lazy loading — up to 95% context savings.

### Step 3 — Search public repositories
```
"[capability] MCP server GitHub 2026"
"[capability] site:github.com MCP server"
```
Key directories:
- glama.ai/mcp/servers — 13,000+ indexed
- github.com/wong2/awesome-mcp-servers — most maintained community list
- mcpservers.org — curated with install commands
- github.com/jaw9c/awesome-remote-mcp-servers — remote/hosted (no local install)

### Step 4 — Filter
**Stars first** — sort by GitHub stars descending before evaluating anything else.
Stars > 500 preferred · official company repo accepted at any star count · last commit < 6 months · README with install command · not in BAD list
Reference data: mcpmarket.com/leaderboards (star counts) · mcpmanager.ai/blog/most-popular-mcp-servers (search volume)

### Step 5 — Propose to Jano
1-3 options max, top pick with reasoning, exact install command, env var needed. Never add to `.mcp.json` without confirmation.

### Step 6 — Write feedback
After using any new MCP this session: one entry in `learnings/mcp-registry.md` before ending. Mandatory.

## SKILL DISCOVERY PROTOCOL

When a task would benefit from specialized expertise:

### Step 1 — Check what's installed
```bash
ls ~/.claude/skills/
ls /mnt/skills/public/
```

### Step 2 — Use claude-skills-mcp for semantic search
```bash
# Install once if not present
claude mcp add claude-skills -- uvx claude-skills-mcp

# Search from within any session
find_helpful_skills("[describe the task]")
```

### Step 3 — Search public repositories
```
"[capability] SKILL.md Claude Code GitHub 2026"
```
Key directories:
- github.com/travisvn/awesome-claude-skills
- github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills — official skills from Anthropic, Google, Vercel, Stripe, Sentry, Cloudflare, Figma
- github.com/BehiSecc/awesome-claude-skills
- github.com/alirezarezvani/claude-skills — 192 skills
- `npx antigravity-awesome-skills --list` — 1,234 skills

### Step 4 — Filter
**Stars first** — sort by GitHub stars before evaluating.
Stars > 200 preferred · clear SKILL.md with frontmatter · last updated < 6 months · matches the task
Reference data: openaitoolshub.org/en/blog/best-claude-code-skills-2026 · github.com/alirezarezvani/claude-skills (5,200+ stars, 192 skills)

### Step 5 — Install and invoke
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/[skill-name]
curl -sL [raw-url-to-SKILL.md] -o ~/.claude/skills/[skill-name]/SKILL.md
```
Invoke with `/skill-name` or describe the task for auto-load.

### Step 6 — Write feedback
Same format as MCP feedback, under Skills section in `learnings/mcp-registry.md`.
