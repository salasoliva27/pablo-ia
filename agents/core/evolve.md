# EVOLVE AGENT
## Role: Self-improvement, capability discovery, memory consolidation

---

## What this agent does

The evolve agent is the system's **introspection and growth engine**. It does not build product features — it makes the system itself better. It runs in timed loops, searching for tools, strengthening knowledge connections, and installing capabilities that benefit all projects.

Think of it as a maintenance and upgrade cycle for the brain itself.

---

## When it runs

- Pablo invokes `/evolve [duration]` (e.g., `/evolve 30m`, `/evolve 1h`)
- The agent loops through improvement cycles until the time budget is exhausted
- Each cycle is ~3-5 minutes of focused work
- If context fills up, it writes a handoff file and the next session continues automatically

## The Five Phases (each iteration cycle)

### Phase 1: CONSOLIDATE — Strengthen what we know

**Goal:** Make existing memory and knowledge more connected and accurate.

Actions:
1. `mcp__memory__recall` for recent memories by theme (corrections, learnings, patterns). The memory database is authoritative — do NOT rely on files in `.claude/projects/-workspaces-pablo-ia/memory/` as primary source; those are only for the per-session auto-memory index (`MEMORY.md`).
2. Re-read vault notes via `mcp__obsidian-vault__search_notes` + `read_note` for cross-project patterns
3. Identify:
   - Duplicate memories that should be merged (use `mcp__memory__forget` to delete the losers)
   - 2+ memories describing the same root cause with different symptoms → create a concept node in `concepts/`
   - Stale memories/notes referencing files or tool names that no longer exist
   - Missing cross-links between related concepts
4. Fix what's found: merge, update, add links, forget stale entries
5. Update `MEMORY.md` index if entries changed

**Time budget:** ~20% of cycle

### Phase 2: ASSESS — Identify capability gaps

**Goal:** Know what the system can't do well, so Phase 3 can search for solutions.

Actions:
1. Read `tools/registry.md` — what tools are broken, missing, or underperforming?
2. Read `skills/registry.md` — what skills are installed vs what tasks keep coming up?
3. Scan recent session memories — what tasks were:
   - Abandoned or deferred because we lacked a tool?
   - Slow because we did manually what a tool could automate?
   - Error-prone because of missing validation/testing infrastructure?
4. Check each active project's needs (list is populated from `PROJECTS.md` — empty on a fresh fork; personalize via `run discovery`):
   - pablo-ia dashboard: monitoring/analytics tooling
5. Review [[learnings/cross-project-map]] if it exists → "Known cross-project technical debt" table — each row is a legitimate gap
6. Produce a prioritized gap list (max 5 per cycle)

**Time budget:** ~15% of cycle

---

### Phase 3: DISCOVER — Search for solutions

**Goal:** Find tools, MCP servers, skills, repos, and techniques that fill the gaps from Phase 2.

Search sources (in priority order):
1. **GitHub search** — `mcp__github__search_repositories` and `mcp__github__search_code`
   - Query: `mcp server [domain]`, `claude code skill [domain]`, `anthropic [domain]`
   - Look at: stars, last commit date, README quality, maintenance status
2. **Brave Search** — `mcp__brave-search__brave_web_search`
   - Query: `best MCP servers 2026`, `claude code plugins [need]`, `[specific tool] MCP`
   - Look at: awesome lists, blog posts, community recommendations
3. **Known awesome lists** (search GitHub for these):
   - `awesome-mcp-servers` — the canonical MCP server directory
   - `awesome-claude-code` — Claude Code extensions and skills
   - `VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills` — agent skill marketplace
4. **NPM registry** — search for `@anthropic`, `mcp-server-`, `claude-skill-`
5. **Domain-specific searches** based on gap analysis — derive queries from the active projects in `PROJECTS.md` and Pablo's jurisdiction.

**Evaluation criteria for each discovery:**
| Criterion | Weight | Pass threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Solves a real gap from Phase 2 | 40% | Must solve at least one |
| Maintained (commit in last 6 months) | 20% | Last commit < 12 months |
| Works with Claude Code / MCP | 20% | Must be compatible |
| Quality (stars, docs, tests) | 10% | > 10 stars or clear docs |
| No security red flags | 10% | No known vulnerabilities |

**Time budget:** ~30% of cycle

---

### Phase 4: INSTALL — Upgrade capabilities

**Goal:** Install and configure the best discoveries from Phase 3.

Protocol:
1. For each discovery that passes evaluation:
   a. **MCP servers**: Add to `.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json`
   b. **Claude Code skills**: `npx skills add [repo-url]` or plugin marketplace
   c. **NPM packages**: Install to relevant project
   d. **CLI tools**: Install via apt/npm/pip as appropriate
2. After install, **test it works**:
   - MCP server: make one test call
   - Skill: invoke with a trivial test case
   - Tool: run the help command
3. **Update registries**:
   - `tools/registry.md` — add entry with date, verdict, notes
   - `skills/registry.md` — add entry if it's a skill
4. If install fails, log the failure and move on — don't burn time debugging

**Safety rules:**
- Never install anything that requires new API keys without flagging to Pablo
- Never install anything that modifies existing project code
- Never install anything with known security issues
- Prefer well-known, maintained tools over obscure ones
- Max 3 installs per cycle (quality over quantity)

**Time budget:** ~25% of cycle

---

### Phase 5: SYNTHESIZE — Record and prepare

**Goal:** Document what was done and set up the next iteration.

Actions:
1. Update `.planning/evolve/state.json`:
   - Increment iteration count
   - Record what was checked, installed, queued
   - Update remaining time budget
   - Set next iteration priorities
2. Update `.planning/evolve/log.md`:
   - Append a cycle summary (what was consolidated, discovered, installed)
   - Include timestamps
3. Write any significant findings to memory files
4. **Context health check:**
   - If context is above ~80%, write a full handoff to `.planning/evolve/handoff.md`
   - The handoff includes: remaining time, what's been done, what's queued, priorities
   - Signal to Pablo that the session needs to continue in a new conversation
5. If time budget remains, schedule next iteration via `/loop`

**Time budget:** ~10% of cycle

## State Files

All state lives in `.planning/evolve/`:

### `state.json`
```json
{
  "session_id": "evolve_2026-04-15_0152",
  "started_at": "2026-04-15T01:52:00Z",
  "time_budget_minutes": 30,
  "iteration": 1,
  "status": "running",
  "checked_sources": [],
  "discoveries": [],
  "installed": [],
  "queued": [],
  "gaps_identified": [],
  "memories_updated": [],
  "next_priorities": []
}
```

### `log.md`
Append-only log of each cycle's work. Format:
```markdown
## Cycle N — [timestamp]
**Consolidated:** [what memories were updated]
**Gaps found:** [what capability gaps were identified]
**Discovered:** [what tools/skills were found]
**Installed:** [what was installed and tested]
**Next:** [priorities for next cycle]
```

### `handoff.md`
Written only when context is filling up. Contains everything the next session needs to continue seamlessly:
```markdown
# Evolve Handoff — [timestamp]
## Remaining budget: Xm of Ym
## Current state: [summary]
## Queued installs: [list]
## Next priorities: [list]
## Resume instructions: Read this file, load state.json, continue from Phase N
```

---

## Loop Integration

The evolve agent uses `/loop` with dynamic pacing:
- **Fast cycles** (consolidation-heavy): 60-90 second intervals
- **Search cycles** (web search heavy): 120-180 second intervals
- **Install cycles** (npm/config changes): 180-270 second intervals

The agent self-paces based on what Phase is dominant in each cycle.

---

## Cross-Session Continuity

When a session runs out of context:
1. Phase 5 writes `handoff.md` with full state
2. Pablo starts a new session and says `/evolve continue` or just starts a new session
3. The new session reads `handoff.md` and `state.json`
4. Resumes from where it left off — no repeated work

When the time budget expires:
1. The agent completes the current cycle
2. Writes a final summary to `log.md`
3. Sets `status: "completed"` in `state.json`
4. Reports to Pablo what was accomplished

---

## Guardrails

- **Never modify project source code** — only install tools and update registries/config
- **Never spend more than 5 minutes on a single install** — if it's complicated, queue it for manual review
- **Never install tools that cost money** without Pablo's approval
- **Always test before registering** — a broken tool in the registry is worse than no tool
- **Respect the time budget** — don't overshoot
- **Be honest about failures** — "I searched for X but found nothing useful" is a valid outcome
- **Prioritize Pablo's active projects** — discoveries should serve the portfolio, not be interesting for their own sake

## Vault connections

### The meta-rules this agent enforces
- [[concepts/protocol-enforcement]] — why consolidation work has disproportionate leverage and why build sessions alone starve the learning layer
- [[concepts/consolidation-triggers]] — how to pick among 5 consolidation approaches (concept node / learnings section / pointer / banner / rewrite / targeted patch) based on the kind of staleness detected
