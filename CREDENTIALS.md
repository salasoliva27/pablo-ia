# CREDENTIALS & TOOL ACCESS CHECK
## Pablo IA — Central Credential Registry
### Last updated: 2026-04-22

---

## HOW THIS WORKS

All secrets live in a private dotfiles repo, loaded as environment variables into every Codespace automatically.

**Never store secrets in any project repo.** Never ask Pablo for a key in a conversation.

When a project needs a tool credential:
- Its own TOOLS.md declares which tools it uses
- It references this file (`pablo-ia/CREDENTIALS.md`) for setup procedure
- It does NOT manage credentials itself

If a project is ever handed off to someone outside the portfolio, copy the relevant rows from this file into that project's own CREDENTIALS.md at handoff time.

---

## RUN A LIVE CHECK

Paste this in any Codespace terminal to see which keys are loaded right now:

```bash
echo "=== ANTHROPIC ===" && \
  [ -n "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" ] && echo "✅ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" || echo "❌ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY MISSING" && \
echo "=== GITHUB ===" && \
  [ -n "$GITHUB_TOKEN" ] && echo "✅ GITHUB_TOKEN" || echo "❌ GITHUB_TOKEN MISSING" && \
echo "=== BRAVE ===" && \
  [ -n "$BRAVE_API_KEY" ] && echo "✅ BRAVE_API_KEY" || echo "❌ BRAVE_API_KEY MISSING" && \
echo "=== SUPABASE ===" && \
  [ -n "$SUPABASE_URL" ] && echo "✅ SUPABASE_URL" || echo "❌ SUPABASE_URL MISSING" && \
  [ -n "$SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" ] && echo "✅ SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY" || echo "❌ SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY MISSING" && \
echo "=== GOOGLE WORKSPACE MCP ===" && \

  [ -n "$GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET" ] && echo "✅ GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET" || echo "❌ GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET MISSING" && \
  [ -f "/home/codespace/.config/google-workspace/tokens.json" ] && echo "✅ OAuth tokens file present" || echo "⚠️  OAuth tokens not yet generated — run: npx @alanse/mcp-server-google-workspace auth" && \
echo "=== N8N ===" && \
  [ -n "$N8N_API_KEY" ] && echo "✅ N8N_API_KEY" || echo "❌ N8N_API_KEY MISSING" && \
  [ -n "$N8N_BASE_URL" ] && echo "✅ N8N_BASE_URL" || echo "❌ N8N_BASE_URL MISSING" && \

## FIXING MISSING CREDENTIALS

All changes go into `salasoliva27/dotfiles/.env`. They auto-load into all future Codespaces. For the current session, also run `export VAR=value` in terminal after editing.

---

### 1. GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID + GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

**Both vars are already in dotfiles.** They just haven't loaded into the current Codespace session because the Codespace was created before they were added.

**To load them now without rebuilding** (run in terminal):
```bash
source /workspaces/.codespaces/.persistedshare/dotfiles/.env
```
Or rebuild this Codespace (Codespaces → Rebuild) — they'll auto-load on next start.

**To verify once loaded:**
```bash
echo $GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID && echo $GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
```

**Then, one-time OAuth flow** (run once per Codespace machine):
```bash
npx @alanse/mcp-server-google-workspace -s user auth
```
This opens a browser, you approve access, tokens are saved to `/home/codespace/.config/google-workspace/`. After this, the MCP server can access Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Sheets, Docs, Slides, Forms, Tasks, and Chat — all from a single auth.

**What this unlocks:**
- Read/send Gmail, search threads, create drafts
- Create, update, delete Calendar events; detect schedule conflicts
- Read/write/upload Google Drive files
- Create and edit Google Sheets (financial trackers, lead lists)
- Create Google Docs (proposals, briefs)
- Create Google Slides (pitch decks, presentations)
- Google Forms (intake forms, surveys)
- Google Tasks (to-do lists synced to Calendar)
- Google Chat (team messaging)

**Where to find / regenerate if needed:**
1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Select project `test-api-383319`
3. APIs & Services → Credentials → your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
4. The client ID and secret are shown there

---

### 2. N8N_API_KEY + N8N_BASE_URL

**What n8n unlocks from Claude Code:**
- Create, read, update, delete workflows
- Trigger workflow executions
- Inspect execution history and logs
- Build the freelance-system automation pipeline from here

**Where to find:**

**If using n8n Cloud (app.n8n.cloud):**
1. Log in at [app.n8n.cloud](https://app.n8n.cloud)
2. Settings (bottom-left gear icon) → API
3. Click "Create an API key"
4. `N8N_BASE_URL` = `https://your-instance-name.app.n8n.cloud`

**If self-hosting n8n:**
1. Go to your n8n URL → Settings → API
2. Generate API key there
3. `N8N_BASE_URL` = your instance URL (e.g., `https://n8n.yourdomain.com`)

**If n8n is not yet set up:**
- Fastest path: [app.n8n.cloud](https://app.n8n.cloud) — free tier includes 5 active workflows
- For production: deploy via Railway, Render, or a VPS. See [n8n self-hosting docs](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/)

Add to `salasoliva27/dotfiles/.env`:
```
N8N_API_KEY=<your_n8n_api_key>
N8N_BASE_URL=https://your-instance.app.n8n.cloud
```

---

### 3. CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN + CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID

**What Cloudflare unlocks from Claude Code:**
- Upload and manage media in R2 (glasses product images for lool-ai, campaign assets)
- Deploy and manage Workers (edge functions)
- Read/write KV stores
- Manage Cloudflare Pages deployments
- DNS management

**Where to find:**

**Account ID:**
1. Log in at [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Click on any domain (or go to the main dashboard)
3. Right sidebar → "Account ID" — copy it

**API Token:**
1. [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com) → top-right profile icon → "My Profile"
2. API Tokens → "Create Token"
3. Use template "Edit Cloudflare Workers" or "Custom token"
4. Recommended permissions for full access:
   - Account: Cloudflare R2 Storage — Edit
   - Account: Workers KV Storage — Edit
   - Account: Workers Scripts — Edit
   - Zone: DNS — Edit (if you want DNS control)
5. Copy the token immediately — shown only once

Add to `salasoliva27/dotfiles/.env`:
```
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=<your_cloudflare_api_token>
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=<your_account_id>
```

---

### 4. VOYAGE_API_KEY

**What it unlocks:** Higher-quality embeddings for the cross-workspace memory MCP (recall/remember). Without it, the system falls back to Anthropic embeddings — still functional, just slightly lower recall quality.

**Lower priority** — everything else works without this.

**Where to find:**
1. Go to [dash.voyageai.com](https://dash.voyageai.com)
2. Sign up / log in
3. API Keys → Create key
4. Free tier includes 50M tokens/month — sufficient for this use case

Add to `salasoliva27/dotfiles/.env`:
```
VOYAGE_API_KEY=<your_voyage_api_key>
```

---

### 5. GITHUB_TOKEN — Permanent cross-repo PAT (do this once, never again)

**Current situation:** Every new Codespace injects a scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` that only works for that repo. This causes 403 on cross-repo pushes and would require manual work every time a new project is created.

**Permanent fix:** One Classic PAT with no expiration in dotfiles. It overrides the scoped Codespace token everywhere — current and future Codespaces get it automatically from dotfiles on creation. Zero per-project setup.

**Steps (one time only):**
1. github.com → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal access tokens → **Tokens (classic)**
2. "Generate new token (classic)"
3. **Expiration: No expiration**
4. **Scopes: check `repo`** (full control of all private repos under your account)
5. Generate → copy immediately (shown only once)

Add to `salasoliva27/dotfiles/.env`:
```
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_new_pat_here
```

**Why Classic PAT, not Fine-grained?**
Fine-grained PATs support "All repositories" but max out at 1 year expiration — you'd rotate it annually. Classic PATs can be set to no expiration. For a solo portfolio, that tradeoff is worth it.

**After this:**
- New Codespaces: PAT loads automatically, push works to any repo from day one
- New projects Claude creates: no manual token step needed ever

## HOW PROJECTS REFERENCE THIS FILE

Each project in the portfolio has its own TOOLS.md that lists which tools it uses. For credential setup, it always points here. Template line for any project's TOOLS.md:

```
## Credential setup
All credentials are managed centrally. See pablo-ia/CREDENTIALS.md for:
- How to run the live check
- How to fix any missing keys in the dotfiles repo
- Where to find / regenerate each key
```

Projects never duplicate credential setup instructions. If instructions drift between repos, the pablo-ia version wins.
